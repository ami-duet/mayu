She lives in beautiful <span class="em">Piura</span> in northwestern <span class="em">Peru</span>, where there are three other countryside communities closer to her, and another three quite farther. Some are bigger than Cerro de Leones, with lots of homes and children her age, and some are so small that they do not have a school.</p>
						<p>But they have one thing in common. All the children in the seven communities do not have clean water - not in their homes nor their schools. With no healthy water to drink, they cannot learn and play as much as they would like.</p>
