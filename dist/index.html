Some are bigger than Cerro de Leones, with lots of homes and children her age, and some are so small that they do not have a school.</p>
						<p>But they have one thing in common. All the children in the seven communities do not have clean water - not in their homes nor their schools. With no healthy water to drink, they cannot learn and play as much as they would like.</p>
